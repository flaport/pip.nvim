# pip.nvim

This repo is a single-shot nvim extension purely created with the following prompt.

> I want a similar extension like crates.nvim called pip.nvim. As the name implies this
> should be for python packages. To limit the scope, this should only analyze
> pyproject.toml files, and only analyze the official pypi.org registry. Also, the
> extension should be written in lua and should assume `uv` is available in the path (and
> should obviously use it).

** No guarentees that this will work. Just publishing for my own use. **
